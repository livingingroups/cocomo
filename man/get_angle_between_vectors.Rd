Get the angle between two vectors specified by their end points using law of cosines.
Vector 1 is defined as the vector pointing from the point \verb{(x1_i, y1_i)} to \verb{(x1_f, y1_f)} and
vector 2 is defined as the vector point from the point \verb{(x2_i, y2_i)} to \verb{(x2_f, y2_f)}.
The angle is defined as the angle produced if the two vectors are joined at the initial
endpoints (rather than head-to-tail). The resulting angle is always positive.
It is only necessary to either provide the points or the x/y vector elements.
