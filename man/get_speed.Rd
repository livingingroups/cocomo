\title{Get speed}
\usage{
get_speed(x_i, y_i, seconds_per_timestep, t_window = 1, forward = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{x_i}{x coordinates of the individual (a vector whose length is the number of timesteps) or of a group centroid}

\item{y_i}{y coordinates of the individual (a vector whose length is the number of timesteps) or of the group centroid}

\item{seconds_per_timestep}{the number of seconds between timestamps (e.g. for data recorded at 1 Hz, the value would be 1, for data recorded every 30 sec, the value would be 30)}

\item{t_window}{the time window over which to compute speed (number of time steps into the future or past)}

\item{forward}{a boolean value (defaults to T) indicating whether to compute speeds forward in time (if T) or backward in time (if F)}
}
\value{
Returns \code{speeds}: a time series of the speed of individual (a vector of the same length as x_i and y_i)
}
\description{
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#stable}{\figure{lifecycle-stable.svg}{options: alt='[Stable]'}}}{\strong{[Stable]}}

Gets an individual's speed over time, using a specified time step to compute the speed
}
\details{
The speed is computed as \code{speeds[t] = sqrt ( (x_i[t+t_window] - x_i[t] )^2 + ( y_i[t+t_window] - y_i[t] )^2 ) / (seconds_per_timestep * t_window)}
Note that by default \code{speeds[t]} gives the instantaneous speed between time \code{t} and time \code{t + t_window}, i.e. the speeds are computed
based on the future not on the past. If \code{forward} is set to \code{F}, the speeds will be computed based on the past, as:
\code{speeds[t] = sqrt ( (x_i[t] - x_i[t-t_window] )^2 + ( y_i[t] - y_i[t-t_window] )^2 ) / (seconds_per_timestep * t_window)}
