\description{
Detects splits and merges (a.k.a. fissions and fusions) using "sticky-DBSCAN"
method from Libera et al. 2023.
}
\details{
Start by defining an adjacency matrix (\code{together} in the code) of which dyads
are "connected" at any moment in time. Dyads are considered to be connected if
they go within a distance \code{R_inner} of one another, and they continue to be
connected until they leave a distance \code{R_outer} of one another on both ends
(before and after) of the period where their distance dropped below \code{R_inner}.
This double threshold makes periods of connectedness more stable by removing
the "flicker" that would result from having a single threshold.

NAs are handled by ending a period of connectedness if an individual has an NA
at the point immediately before / after (if the were connected after / before
that NA). Individuals with NAs are not included in the together matrix and will
not be included in the groups.
Once connectedness of dyads is determined, merge dyads together into groups by
using DBSCAN on 1 - \code{together} as the distance matrix, with \code{eps} equal to
something small (.01 in the code).
Store these groups in \code{groups_list}, a list of lists whose length is equal to
\code{n_times}.
Stepping through the \code{groups_list}, identify all changes in group membership,
i.e. consecutive time points when the groups do not match. The algorithm flags
any change, including instances where individuals disappear or reappear in
groups due to missing data (but these are later ignored). Store in \code{changes}
data frame.

In a last step, identify all splits ('fission'), merges ('fusion'), and things that
cannot be classified as either fissions or fusions because they contain elements
of both ('shuffle'). This is done by constructing a bipartite network at each time
step t, where groups at time t are connected to groups at time t + 1 if they share
at least 1 member. Then, we identify the connected components of this bipartite
network. Components where a single group (node) at time t is connected to multiple
groups (nodes) at time t + 1 get identified and classified as \code{event_type = 'fission'}.
Components where multiple nodes at time t are connected to a single node at time t + 1
are classified as \code{event_type = 'fusion'}. Components where a single node at time t
is connected to a single node at time t + 1 are skipped (they are not fissions, fusions,
or shuffles). All other events where more complex things happen are classified as
\code{event_type = 'shuffle'}.

After events are identified, various event features are computed and saved in a data frame.
See list of outputs for more details.
