\value{
Returns a data frame  containing dyadic interactions between a and b.
Contains columns: \code{t1}, \code{t2}, \code{t3}, \code{initiator}, \code{responder}, \code{type}, \code{disparity}, \code{strength},\code{disparity_additive}, and \code{strength_additive}.
The \code{disparity} and \code{strength} are as defined in Strandburg-Peshkin et al. 2015, whereas
\code{disparity_additive} and \code{strength_additive} are alternative formulations of these metrics that add the components together instead of multiplying them.

\section{Details on fission and fusion events}{


If \code{include_initial_fusion} is set to T, the script will also return the
"fusion" defined by the beginning of the sequence and the first minimum.
If \code{include_final_fission} is set to T, the script will also return the
"fission" defined by the last minimum and the end of the sequence. If the first or
last min/max values are not minima, half events will not be returned for them.
The purpose of this option is that if this code is used on a sequence where two
individuals come together and then split apart (in fission-fusion analyses), the
first and last "half events" represent fusion and fission events, so these
are extracted. In normal use cases, this value should be set to F (default).
However in cases where this analysis is being run on the "together periods"
of two individuals in a fission-fusion analysis, these values can be set to T to return
the times and initiators of the initial fusion and eventual fission event.
In the case of fission and fusion events, there are only two time points return (\code{t1} and \code{t2}).
\code{t3} is defined as \code{NA}. The \code{initiator} is defined as the individual with the greater
displacement during the period \code{t1} to \code{t2} and the \code{responder} is the other
individual. The \code{strength} and \code{disparity} are defined in parallel to those for
pulls and anchors, but using only the one time period (\code{t1} to \code{t2}). To make the
values somewhat comparable to pulls and anchors, these values are squared.
