\arguments{
\item{xa:}{x coordinates for individual a (vector of length \code{n_times})}

\item{xb:}{x coordinates for individual b (vector of length \code{n_times})}

\item{ya:}{x coordinates for individual a (vector of length \code{n_times})}

\item{a:}{index of the first individual}

\item{b:}{index of the second individual}

\item{NA_tolerance:}{How big of a gap in the vector (missing timesteps), created by NAs, is tolerated and therefore still combined into a single continuous dataset (numeric, positive integer)}

\item{min_time:}{the minimum length (timesteps) of a resulting time block that will still be used for analysis (numeric, positive integer)}

\item{verbose:}{If verbose = TRUE, then print out the size of each NA gap

\value{
Returns a data frame  containing dyadic interactions between a and b.
Contains columns: \code{t1}, \code{t2}, \code{t3}, \code{initiator}, \code{responder}, \code{type}, \code{disparity}, \code{strength},\code{disparity_additive}, and \code{strength_additive}.
}
\description{
Create a list of time blocks using NAs in the dataset as seperation points, then run the \code{get_pulls_and_anchors} function on each of these blocks separately.
}
\details{
Time blocks are created by splitting the dataset at the indexes of NAs. If the length of the NA-chain is below "NA_tolerance", then the script will ignore these NAs and not split at that position.
Instead, the script will fill the gap with an interpolation of values between the previous and next existing measured value entry.
This results in the datapoints staying connected/in a single time block for small breaks. If the NA-chain in the dataset is longer than "NA_tolerance",
then the values before and after that chain are split into separate time blocks.
If "min_time" != NULL, then the script will remove all time blocks shorter than the specified value (usually time steps), resulting only in time blocks of relevant lengths.
If filtering by "min_time" leaves no time blocks to analyze, then the script will return "NULL".

Note that if either \code{include_initial_fusion} or \code{include_final_fission} are true, this function will treat each time block separately. In other words,
a fission and/or fusion might be detected for each time block.
