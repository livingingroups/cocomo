#'
#' Get the simplified turn and speed influence (movement and positional) between all pairs of individuals
#' `i` and `j`, or, if `centroid = T` for all individuals `i` on the group centroid excluding `i`.
#'
#' @details
#' The simplified movement turn influence of individual `i` on individual `j` (`turn_influence_movement[i,j]`)
#' is defined as the probability that `j` turns right in the future given that `i` moved
#' right relative to `j`'s past heading at a speed above a threshold value `min_right_speed`,
#' that `j` turns left in the future given that `i` moved left relative to `j`'s past heading at a speed above a threshold
#' value `min_left_speed`.
#'
#' The simplified positional turn influence of individual `i` on individual `j` (`turn_influence_position[i,j]`)
#' is defined as the probability that `j` turns right in the future given that `i` was located
#' at least `min_right_dist` meters right of individual `j` relative to `j`'s current position
#' and heading, or that `j` turns left in the future given that `i` was located
#' at least `min_left_dist` meters left of individual `j` relative to `j`'s current position
#' and heading.
#'
#' The simplified movement speed influence of individual `i` on individual `j` (`speed_influence_movement[i,j]`)
#' is defined as the probability that `j` speeds up in the future along the vector defined by `j`'s heading in the past,
#' given that `i` was moving at least a speed `min_faster_speed_diff` faster than `j` along `j`'s past heading direction, or
#' slows down along the vector defined by `j`'s heading in the past given that `j` was moving at least a speed `min_slower_speed_diff`
#' slower than `i` along the same vector in the past.
#'
#' The simplified positional speed influence of individual `i` on individual `j` (`speed_influence_position[i,j]`)
#' is defined as the probability that `j` speeds up in the future along the vector defined by `j`'s heading in the past
#' given that `i` was in front of `j` by at least `min_front_pos` meters relative to `j`'s current position and past heading,
#' or that `j` slows down in the future along the vector defined by `j`'s heading in the past given that `i` was
#' behind `j` by at least `min_back_pos` relative to `j`'s current position and past heading.
#'
#' Future headings and speeds are computed either using a fixed temporal window `t_window` forward in time (if `heading_type = 'temporal'`)
#' or based on spatial discretization with a radius `spatial_R` (if `heading_type = 'spatial'`), i.e. defining the heading based on the
#' when the focal individual has moved a distance `spatial_R` from its current location. Similarly, past headings and speeds
#' are computed by looking backward in time either at a fixed temporal window (`t_window`) or based on a fixed displacement distance (`spatial_R`).
#'
#' The parameters specifying minimum speeds and distances left-right and front-back are either set manually (not recommended) or,
#' if `min_percentile` is specified, based on percentiles of the relevant distributions of these variables across all dyads
#' (or across all individuals relative to the group centroid, if `centroid = T`). The variable
#' `min_percentile` overrides the manually set minimum speeds / distances.
#' The minimum speeds (or distances) are computed as follows. First, split the distribution of relative left-right
#' speeds (for example) across all dyads into those greater than and those less than 0. Take the absolute value of all speeds to
#' define a positive speed for both directions. Next, compute the quantile `min_percentile` for each distribution (left and right) separately.
#' Finally, set `min_left_speed` and `min_right_speed` at the computed
#' values. If `symmetrize_lr = T` (recommended), take instead the mean value of the quantiles for both distributions and use it
#' for both thresholds (this will result in using the same relative speed when going right or left as a threshold - otherwise these could be different if `symmetrize_lr = F`)
#' The same procedure is done for left-right positions, front-back relative speeds, and front-back positions, using the same value of `min_percentile`. In the case of
#' speeds, no symmetrization is done because speed differences and front-back distances are not expected to be symmetrical.
#'
#' If `breaks` is set, headings that go across breaks in the data as specified by this vector are not included in the computations.
#'
#' If `max_distance` is set, only compute the scores based on times when the distance between a given pair of individuals (or between)
#' an individual and the group centroid) is less than `max_distance`. By default `max_distance = NULL` and this filtering will not be done.
#'
#' If `min_past_speed` is set, only compute the scores based on times when the follower individual (or the centroid, if `centroid = T`)
#' was initially moving at a minimum past speed. By default, `min_past_speed = NULL` and this filtering will not be done.

#' @returns Returns a list containing matrices for the 4 different types of influence, as well as other computed metrics (if `output_details = T`).
#' See "Additional information about returned objects" section below for a list of outputs.
#'
#' @section Additional information about returned objects:
#'
#' The output list conatins the following objects:
#'
#' `params` list of parameters used in the calculation (see input variables for descriptions)
#'
#' `turn_influence_movement`: `i x j` matrix representing movement turn influence of individual `i` on individual `j`
#'
#' `turn_influence_position`: `i x j` matrix representing positional turn influence of individual `i` on individual `j`
#'
#' `speed_influence_movement`: `i x j` matrix representing movement speed influence of individual `i` on individual `j`
#'
#' `speed_influence_position`: `i x j` matrix representing positions speed influence of individual `i` on individual `j`
#'
#' If `centroid = T`, everything is instead computed at the centroid level (with the centroid as follower, replacing individual `j`).
#' In this case, the output matrices will still be the same shape as those for the dyadic case, but they will have `NA`s for all columns
#' except `j=1` (representing the influence of each individual `i` on the centroid excluding that individual).
#' This parallel structure is for compatibility between dyadic and centroid-based analyses.
#'
#' If `output_details = T`, some additional parameters and the following computed matrices / arrays will also be outputted:
#'
#' `lr_speed`: `i x j x t` array of the past left-right speed of individual `i` relative to the past heading of individual `j` at time `t`
#'
#' `lr_pos`: `i x j x t` array of the past left-right position of individual `i` relative to the current position and past heading of individual `j` at time `t`
#'
#' `fb_speed`: `i x j x t` array of the past front-back speed difference between individual `i` and individual `j` along the vector of the past heading of individual `j` at time `t`
#'
#' `fb_pos`: `i x j x t` array of the past front-back position of individual `i` relative to the current position and past heading of individual `j` at time `t`
#'
#' `turn_angle`: `j x t` matrix of the turning angle of individual `j` between the past and future at time `t`
#'
#' `speed_up`: `j x t` matrix of the difference in speed of individual `j` between future and past at time `t`, project along `j`'s own past heading
#'
#' The output matrices `turn_angle[j,t]` and `speed_up[j,t]` then represent the centroid excluding individual `j`, rather than
#' the data for individual `j` as in the dyadic case.
#' Similarly, the output arrays with dimensions `i x j x t` will have `NA`s for all values of `j > 1`, and the `j = 1`
#' values represent the speeds / positions of individuals relative to the centroid (excluding `i`)
