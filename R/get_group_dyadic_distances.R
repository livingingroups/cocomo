#' Computes the distance between each pair of individuals over time.

#' @author Ariana Strandburg-Peshkin (primary author)
#' @author NOT YET CODE REVIEWED
#' @param xs `N x n_times` matrix giving x coordinates of each individual over time
#' @param ys `N x n_times` matrix giving y coordinates of each individual over time
#' @returns `N x N x n_times` `dyad_dists` array giving dyadic distance between all pairs of individuals at each time step
#' `dyad_dists[i,j,t]` gives the distance between individuals `i` and `j` at time `t`
