#'
#' Analyze (and, if `make_plot=T` make a visualization of) a fission-fusion event.
#'
#' @details
#' This function takes in information about a fission or fusion event as well as
#' tracking data to identify relevant time points in the fission or fusion event and compute relevant metrics about the event.
#' First, the `start_time` and `end_time` of the event are determined based on
#' a double threshold method, then a `before_time` and `after_time` are identified.
#' This identifies 3 phases of the event: before (`before_time:start_time`), during
#' (`start_time:end_time`) and after (`end_time:after_time`).
#' Finally the displacements and speeds of the subgroups during these phases and various
#' relevant angles are calculated. More details are given below. Note that this function can only
#' consider events involving 2 subgroups.

#'
#' @section Additional details:
#'
#' *How are the start and end time identified?*
#'
#' As a start, we look at a window of time around an identified event (can be
#' manually or automatically identified). The size of the window is determined by
#' the parameter '`max_time`', and we go from `(tidx - max_time):(tidx + max_time)`
#' where `tidx` is the identified event time index.
#'
#' Within the window, we compute the distance between the centroids of the two
#' subgroups that are splitting or merging at each time point.
#' We then use a double threshold method to determine the start and end point of
#' the fission or fusion event within that time window. To do so, we first
#' categorize all time points as being above the higher threshold `thresh_h` (2),
#' between the two thresholds (1), or below the lower threshold `thresh_l` (0). We
#' then identify contiguous periods of time where the dyadic distance went from
#' 2-111111(any number of ones)-0 (i.e. high-mid-low) for a fusion or 0-1111...-2
#' (i.e. low-mid-high) for a fission. If there are multiple possible time periods
#' detected within the window, we choose the one where the start time is closest to `tidx`. (See also
#' subtlety 1 below).
#'
#' *How are the before and after times identified?*
#'
#' The before time is defined as the time point `tidx - time_window` (default
#' `time_window = 300` time steps), unless the two groups are not sufficiently together (for
#' a fission) or apart (for a fusion) at that time. If the latter, the `before_time`
#' is identified as the point just before the two subgroups cross a threshold `thresh_m` midway
#' between the upper and lower thresholds used to define the start and end times
#' (i.e. usually at `(thresh_l + thresh_h) / 2`, though if the upper or lower
#' thresholds get modified due to *subtlety 1* below, this will also modify `thresh_m`
#' accordingly).
#'
#' The logic here is that, for a fusion we are looking for what the full group (combination of the
#' two eventual subgroups) was doing before they began to split. However, we do not
#' want this point to fall during a prior fusion event, so we require the centroids
#' of the two subgroups to be less than `(thresh_l + thresh_h) / 2` distance apart.
#' The after time is defined in an analogous way, but using the time period after the
#' event. It is usually set to `tidx + time_window`, unless the subgroups come back too
#' close together (for a fission) or go too far apart (for a fusion). Again, we use
#' the time just prior to crossing the midway point between the two thresholds as
#' the `after_time`, if this threshold is crossed before `time_window` seconds has elapsed.
#'
#' *How are the displacements defined?*
#'
#' We compute the displacement of the centroid of each subgroup (group A and group B)
#' as well as the displacement of the centroid of the combined group (group AB) during
#' each of the time windows: before (`before_time:start_time`), during (`start_time:end_time`)
#' and after (`end_time:after_time`).
#'
#' *How are the angles defined?*
#'
#' We define 3 relevant angles relevant to a fission event (might define more later
#' for merge events):
#' `split_angle`: this is the angle at which the two groups split. It is defined as
#' the angle traced out by the points `p_A(end_time)`, `p_AB(start_time)`, and `p_B(end_time)`
#' where `p_A(t)` is the position of subgroup A's centroid at time `t` and likewise
#' for subgroup B and the combined group.
#' `turn_angle_A`: the turning angle of subgroup A. This is defined as the angle
#' formed by the points `p_AB(before_time)`, `p_AB(start_time)`, and `p_A(end_time)`
#' turn_angle_B: likewise for subgroup B
#' Note that all angles use the point `p_AB(start_time)` as their central point
#'
#' *How are departure time difference and departure angular difference calculated?*
#'
#' To calculate the departure time difference and angular difference, we start by computing
#' the centroid of the full group at the event _start time_ - call this the _group start position_.
#' We then determine, for each individual in each subgroup, a _departure time_ that is defined
#' as the first time after _start time_ when that individual crossed a threshold distance (`depart_or_arrive_radius`)
#' from the _start position_. We then compute the _departure heading_ for each individual as the
#' vector pointing from the _group start position_ to the position of the individual at its _departure time_.
#'
#' Once we have computed _departure times_ and _departure headings_ for each individual, we compute
#' an aggregated metric of the disagreement in times and headings for the entire event. For departure time, we
#' calculate the _time disagreement_ as the absolute difference between the mean `departure_time` of each subgroup.
#' Similarly, for departure heading, we calculate the _directional disagreement_ as the angle between
#' the (vector) mean heading of each subgroup. The angle between vectors is defined between
#' 0 and pi radians. The time difference is defined in seconds.
#'
#' We can do the equivalent calculations for fusion events. Here, we define the _group end position_
#' as the centroid of the combined group at the `end_time`, and use this position as the reference point
#' for all the other calculations. Looking backward in time, we find the _arrival time_ for each individual,
#' defined as the latest time before the _end time_ where that individual remained outside a threshold
#' distance of `depart_or_arrive_radius`. The headings and time differences are then computed as above, and the
#' differences between times and angles as well.
#'
#' To avoid having different column names for all of the above variables in the code, we create the columns:
#' `group_start_or_end_position` which is defined as the _group start position_ for a fission and the _group end position_ for a fusion,
#' `depart_or_arrive_times` which is a list of _departure times_ (in the case of fissions) or _arrival times_ (in the case of fusions),
#' `depart_or_arrive_headings` which is a lsit of _departure headings_ (in the case of fissions) or _arrival headings_ (in the case of fusions),
#' `depart_or_arrive_time_diff` which is a single number representing the _time disagreement_ of departure (for fissions) or arrival (for fusions) times,
#' `depart_or_arrive_heading_diff` which is a single number representing the _directional disagreement_ of departure (for fissions) or arrival (for fusions) headings.
#'
#' *SUBTLETIES*:
#'
#' *Subtlety 1*: Sometimes, due to the multi-scale nature of these events and the
#' fact that we are approximating subgroup locations with centroids, the dyadic
#' distance does not go below the lower threshold `thresh_l` and/or above the upper
#' threshold `thresh_h`. In this case, we still try to identify the `start_time` and
#' end_time, but modify the thresholds as follows:
#'
#' First, let's define the period between `tidx - max_time` and `tidx` as the *prior period*,
#' the period between `tidx`  and `tidx + max_time` as the *subsequent period*, and the
#' period between `(tidx - max_time/2)` and `(tidx + max_time/2)` as the *middle period*.
#'
#' For a fission, if the dyadic distance does not go above `thresh_h` in the *subsequent period*,
#' then we instead replace `thresh_h` with the maximum - .001 of the dyadic
#' distance during that time period. Second, if the dyadic distance during the *middle period*
#' does not drop below `thresh_l`, then we instead move `thresh_l` to the minimum + .001
#' of the dyadic distance during the *middle period*.
#'
#' For a fusion, everything is reversed. If the dyadic distance does not go
#' above `thresh_h` during the *prior period*, we replace `thresh_h` with the maximum - .001
#' of the dyadic distance during the *subsequent period*. And if the dyadic distance does
#' not go below `thresh_l` during the *middle period*, we replace `thresh_l` with the minimum + .001
#' of the dyadic distance during the *middle period*.
#'
#' In very rare cases, due to these rules the upper bound may get changed to
#' something below the original `thresh_l`, or the lower bound may get changed to
#' something above the original `thresh_h`. In that case, we revert to the original thresholds.
#'
#' *Subtlety 2*: NA handling. NAs are handled in a couple of different ways:
#'
#' For finding the `start_time` and `end_time`, NAs are essentially ignored, and cannot
#' be part of the sequence from `start_time:end_time` (at least not in terms of the)
#' dyadic distance... individuals can drop out and they will just be excluded from
#' the centroid calculation.
#'
#' If no start and end times are found, nothing else is computed (all output values are
#' filled in with `NA`s or `NULL` for matrices).
#'
#' For finding the `before_time` and `after_time`, if an `NA` is hit in the forward or
#' backward direction, the `before_time` (or respectively, the `after_time`) is marked
#' as `NA`. Metrics involving that time point can then not be computed and are also set to
#' `NA`.
#'
#' If the `start_time` and `end_time` are in different data chunks (as specified by `breaks`), then both are given `NA`.
#'
#' If the `before_time` and `start_time`, or `after_time` and `end_time`, are in different data chunks (as specified by `breaks`), then
#' both are given NA.
#'
#' If the `before_time` or `after_time` are `NA`, then other metrics stemming from those times get `NA`
#'
#' @param events a data frame of fission-fusion events, output from `identify_splits_and_merges`
#' @param i index of the row to use in the events table

#' @param time_window time steps to move backward or forward in time to identify the before and after times (units are timesteps, not seconds)
