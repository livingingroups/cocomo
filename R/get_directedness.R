#' Get directedness
#'
#' @description
#' `r lifecycle::badge("experimental")`
#'
#' Gets the directedness of a trajectory over a given time window, as a function of time.
#'
#' @details
#' The directedness a number which ranges from 0 to 1 where 1 is a straight path and 0 is a highly tortuous path.
#' It is defined as the net displacement (distance along a straight-line path from point A to point B) divided by the
#' path length (total distance traveled along the actual path from point A to point B).
#'
#' NOTE: Keep in mind that the time window `t_window` should be given as the number of time points of data to use when computing directedness, so the unit is number of timesteps, not seconds.

#' @param	x_i vector of x positions for an individual (or the group centroid) of length `n_times`
#' @param	y_i vector of y positions for an individual (or the group centroid) of length `n_times`
#' @param	t_window window of time to use for computing directedness (must be an even number) - the directedness for time t will be computed using position data from `t - t_window / 2` to `t + t_window / 2`
#' @returns vector of directedness of the trajectory as a function of time
