#' Gets the number of individuals within a radius `R` of a focal individual `i` at each time point
#'
#' @author Ariana Strandburg-Peshkin (primary author)
#' @author NOT YET CODE REVIEWED
#'
#' @param	xs `N x n_times` matrix giving x positions of all `N` individuals over `n_times` timesteps
#' @param	ys `N x n.times` matrix giving y positions of all `N` individuals over `n_times` timesteps
#' @param	i the focal individual (for whom the local density will be computed)
#' @param	R the radius over which to compute the local density (in same units as `xs` and `ys`)
#' @returns Vector of length `n_times` giving the local density around the focal individual (number of individuals within a radius R) at each time point
#' @export
